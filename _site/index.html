    <h1>Today I Learned</h1>


  <h2>Tue, 14 of Oct 2014</h2>
  <p>I started making a <code>before_filter</code> that would redirect a request from a bot.
After returning to the code, I decided it would be better to <code>rescue_from
SomeCustomError, with: :what_was_previously_a_before_filter</code> so that the code
did not have to run on every single request. This probably amounts to minimal
performance gains in terms of actual execution time, but I think it brought
clarity to the code by having the happy path occur first.</p>

<p>Taking the time to organize your folders/files into something predictable needs
to be done quickly when you’re working with branches of code. Every divergent
branch means a delay in making it happen.</p>


  <h2>Mon, 13 of Oct 2014</h2>
  <p>Reminded of a proposal I made long ago. For responsive design, start at one
size, and head in one direction, using either min-width or max-width, but not
both.</p>

<p>I spent time today moving some behavior of a model into a concern, specific to
that model. Rather than putting it into
<code>app/models/concerns/person_pending_request_count</code> I put it into
<code>app/models/person/pending_request_count</code>. I liked this change, because it
communicated that only Person should be using this. It’s not a general mixin,
though it could easily become one. Then in the person class, I just included
it with <code>include Person::PendingRequestCount</code>.</p>


  <h2>Tue, 30 of Sep 2014</h2>
  <p>Rails UJS’ <code>ajax:success</code> and <code>ajax:error</code> only apply to XHRs originating from
a <code>data-remote="true"</code> source. If you’d like them to apply to all XHRs in your
page or application, you’re gonna have to wire that up.</p>

<p>In slim, you can use <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code> or both after your tag to add leading or
trailing whitespace, respectively.</p>
